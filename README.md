The file "plotAcquisition.m" contains the updated code to plot the correlation graphs in a 3D space which gives a nice cleaner look if you are interested in 
analyzing the Multipath GNSS signals using FGI GSRX receiver.

The code starts from line #66 and ends at line #94. You can modify the plot parameters, legends and axis details by editing the corresponding lines in the code.


**How to Use**

Download the original FGI GSRX receiver from here https://github.com/nlsfi/FGI-GSRx
Download the file (doAcquisition.m) and replace the original file in the FGI GSRX folder present at FGI-GSRX/Plot/plotAcquisition.m with this file.
Execute the original FGI GSRX as per their guidelines and then you will see the 3D mesh plot in the GNSS acquisition phase.
